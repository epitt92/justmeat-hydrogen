             <strong>Refund & Cancellation Policy:</strong><br/>
             At Just Meats, we understand that there may be situations where you need to cancel your order or subscription. Please review our cancellation policy to know how cancellations are handled in different scenarios:
         </p>
         <p className='my-3'><strong>*Cancellations must be done either online individually or with direct communication on the phone with one of our customer service representatives. *</strong></p>
        <p className='my-3'>*Please make sure to see if you are on a subscription service or not. If you desire a single order please double check before checking out to confirm it is set on “ONETIME Order” instead of “SUBSCRIPTION” before ordering. *</p>
        <p className='my-3'><strong>1. Shipping Issues:</strong></p>
        <p>If your order experiences shipping issues or delays, please contact our customer support team immediately at <a href="mailto:support@justmeats.com" className='underline '>support@justmeats.com</a> <span className='underline'>/888-343-1242.</span> We will work to resolve the issue and provide you with the best possible solution. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the issue, this may include issuing a credit to your account or rescheduling your shipping date. Once the shipment is in UPS’s hands or it is being shipped in our 1–2-day travel window. Customers are not able to ship the food back to Just Meats since it is deemed as perishable items. If the delivery failed, meaning UPS had an issue with your order, please call us and we can discuss sending a new order out or adding a credit.</p>
        <p className='my-3'><strong>2. Wrong Addresses:</strong></p>
        <p className='my-3'>Please confirm your address is correct before checking out and processing your order. If you've entered the wrong shipping address, please contact us as soon as possible. We'll make every effort to correct the address before the order is in movement and shipped. If the order has already been fulfilled/ shipped to the incorrect address, we will not be able to issue a refund or replacement. We cannot ship to P.O. Boxes.</p>
        <p className='my-3'><strong>3. Delayed Shipping:</strong></p>
        <p className='my-3'>If your order is delayed due to unforeseen circumstances or Holidays, we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Contact our customer support team to discuss options available to you, which may include rescheduling the delivery or providing credit for your next order. The estimated time to receive your order will be <span className='underline'>around</span> 1-2 weeks from the day you place your order (depending on volume). At times your order may come earlier than 1 week. However, the typical standards are 1-2 week from the time of placing your order.</p>
        <p className='my-3'><strong>4. Canceling Your Own Subscription:</strong></p>
        <p className='my-3'>You can cancel your subscription at any time. To cancel your subscription, please log in to your account and navigate to the subscription settings. We require cancellation requests of your subscriptions to be made at least 1 day prior to the renewal date. If a cancellation request is received after 24 hrs from the renewal date, you will be <span className='underline'>charged.</span>  Please look at your email to cancel or skip your order or subscription at any time. You may call in to our customer experience team to change your next shipment from 15 days to 30 or any set you would prefer.</p>
        <p className='my-3'><strong>5. Warm Meat:</strong></p>
        <p className='my-3'>In the event you receive meat products that are not at the appropriate temperature upon delivery, please contact us immediately. We will assess the situation and determine the appropriate action (which would require pictures of the meat product and ice packs on arrival) to be sent to the customer experience team. If the vacuum seal is in anyway torn or even bubbling of the seal, please send those pictures in and contact our customer experience team. This may lead to a replacement order or replacement meat.</p>
        <p className='my-3'><strong>General Cancellation Notes:</strong></p>
